[Abstract]

This code has not been used to create a python module and contains inconsistencies which will prevent its use for other applications without significant modifications. 

All generated code files are contained in this repository, including those that no longer function, and those that were not used during analysis in the final research product. 

Files are names in the format 'File__Version.r,' the most recent version will be the file with the highest number.For example, Data_Extract_2.r is more recent than Data_Extract_1.r.
